# Network Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project employs machine learning algorithms, specifically Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to detect network intrusions. The goal is to develop robust models capable of identifying malicious activities within a network, enhancing the overall security posture.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

- **Decision Tree:** Utilized for its interpretability and ability to handle complex decision-making processes.
  
- **Random Forest:** Employed to improve accuracy by leveraging the strength of multiple decision trees through ensemble learning.

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Chosen for its effectiveness in classifying data points, especially in high-dimensional spaces.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the renowned KDD Cup 1999 dataset, a benchmark dataset commonly used for evaluating intrusion detection systems. This dataset represents a diverse set of network traffic scenarios, enabling a comprehensive assessment of machine learning models.

## Metrics

The project evaluates the performance of the machine learning models using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy Score:** Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.

- **Precision Score:** Indicates the accuracy of positive predictions, minimizing false positives.

- **Recall Score:** Measures the model's ability to identify all relevant instances, minimizing false negatives.

- **F1 Score:** Balances precision and recall, providing a comprehensive evaluation of model performance.

- **Model Built Time:** Duration taken to train each machine learning model.

- **Overall False Positive Rate:** The rate of incorrectly identified benign instances.

- **Zero One Loss:** The proportion of misclassified instances.

## Results

The project achieves impressive accuracy scores, precision, recall, and F1 scores across the evaluated machine learning algorithms. The comprehensive metrics provide a detailed understanding of each model's performance.
